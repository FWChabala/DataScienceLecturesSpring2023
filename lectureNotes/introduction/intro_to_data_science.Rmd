# Installation Details

## Important installations
You will need to install the following: \vskip .1in

**Mac Users**

* R and R Studio
* Know how to access a terminal (Rstudio or Terminal)
* git (type "git --version" in the terminal)

\vskip .1in
	
**Windows Users:**

* R and R Studio
* A terminal app (Git Bash, MobaXterm, Putty)
* Git for Windows

## R and Rstudio

See instructions at: https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/installing-r-rstudio.html

## Accessing the terminal and installing Git

See instructions at: https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/accessing-the-terminal-and-installing-git.html

## For Windows: link Git Bash and RStudio

We can access the terminal either through RStudio or by opening Git Bash directly. For RStudio, set Git Bash as the default Unix shell: go to preferences (under the File pull down menu), then select Terminal, then select Git Bash:

# Keeping the "Science" in Data Science

## Domain Knowledge

**Domain knowledge** is knowledge of a specific, specialized discipline or field, in contrast to general (or domain-independent) knowledge. For example, in describing a software engineer may have general knowledge of computer programming as well as domain knowledge about developing programs for a particular industry. People with domain knowledge are often regarded as specialists or experts in their field. (Wikipedia!)
